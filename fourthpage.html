<font face = "pristina" color = "orange" size = "22">In this whole universe, one of the greatest and pleasant thing is the “Nature”. <br>
She always want to encourage every organism to develop, to accommodate in this world of survival.<br> 
As a mother, she takes care of every organism regardless of their skills and superiority or size, like every organism belongs to her.<br>
<img src = "earthtree.png" height = "154" width = "176"><br>
For birds, she gave trees, for fishes, she gave seas and for animals, she gave land. <br>
She customised a very simple program and works on a basic principle i.e., the waste for us is the best for other, 
through which she wants to make our life more towards humanity and less towards selfishness.<br>
Everything that would become a necessity in future, is already present with time; like she knows every requirements of everyone.
